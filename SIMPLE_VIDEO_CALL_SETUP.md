# Simple Video Call Setup (No WebSocket Dependencies)

## Problem Solved âœ…
Removed all WebSocket dependencies that were causing classpath issues. Now using simple REST API for signaling.

## What Changed
1. **Removed WebSocket** - No more complex WebSocket configurations
2. **REST-based Signaling** - Uses simple HTTP polling for WebRTC signaling
3. **Simplified Dependencies** - Only core Spring Boot dependencies

## How It Works Now
- **Frontend**: Polls REST API every 2 seconds for incoming signals
- **Backend**: Stores signals in memory and serves them via REST endpoints
- **WebRTC**: Still works peer-to-peer for actual video/audio streams

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend
```bash
# Just run the main application class from your IDE
# File: ProjectbackendApplication.java
```

### 2. Frontend
```bash
cd "e:\SIH 25\TeleMedicine_Application\project"
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints Available
- `POST /api/webrtc/signal` - Send WebRTC signals
- `GET /api/webrtc/signal/{userId}` - Get pending signals
- `POST /api/calls/initiate` - Start a call
- `PUT /api/calls/{id}/accept` - Accept call
- `PUT /api/calls/{id}/reject` - Reject call

## Testing Video Calls
1. Open browser as Doctor â†’ Go to appointments â†’ Click "Start Consultation"
2. Open another browser as Patient â†’ Should see call notification
3. Accept call â†’ Video call should start

## No More Errors! ðŸŽ‰
The application should now start without any WebSocket classpath errors.
